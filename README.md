# DTSA-5511,  Week 4: NLP Disaster Tweets Kaggle Mini-Project
## Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets
### Predict which Tweets are about real disasters and which ones are not

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is an important area in Deep Learning, It enables machines to understand, interpret, and generate human language.

In this project, we are focusing on the assignment based on a Kaggle competition that is utilizing Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to analyze and categorize tweets into two categories, make a model to classify the Tweet is a real disasters or not.
